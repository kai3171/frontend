    <p style="color: rgb(82, 83, 84);">Welcome to our website! This user manual will help you quickly understand and use our services. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact our customer support team.</p> <hr/> <h4>Table of Contents</h4> <ol> <li>Registration and Login</li> <li>Prediction Module</li> <li>Evaluation Module</li> </ol> <h4>Registration and Login</h4> <p>The Registration and Login module can be found at the top right corner. The Registration, Login, and Reset Password functions can be accessed by clicking on the "Login" button.</p> <p><strong>How to create a new account?</strong></p> <ul> <li>An educational email address is required to create a new account.</li> <li>When creating a new account, you should input the following information on the Register page:</li> <ul> <li>First Name</li> <li>Last Name</li> <li>Institution Email (Educational emails only)</li> <li>Password</li> <li>Password confirmation (Same as the password)</li> <li>Institution or University</li> <li>Country</li> <li>Job Title or Position</li> </ul> <li>After providing the required information, you need to complete the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) to verify the effectiveness of your email. Click the "Send CAPTCHA" button and check your email inbox to retrieve the number and input it into the appropriate field.</li> <li>Once completed, click the register button to create your new account.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How to log in to an existing account?</strong></p> <ul> <li>After clicking the login button at the top right corner, you will find the login module.</li> <li>Enter the email and password used during the account creation process.</li> <li>Click the login button to access the website.</li> </ul> <p><strong>What to do if I forget my password?</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can find the "Forget Password?" option on the right side of the login module.</li> <li>Click on the "Forget Password?" option to initiate the password reset process.</li> </ul> <h4>Prediction Module</h4> <p>This part allows you to upload your dataset and use the clocks, which are a type of predictive algorithms using Methylation data to predict an individual's age after logging in. Our original method can be found in the "PREDICTED RESULT SCATTER PLOT" section on the result page. To use the prediction part, you need two files: the pheno file and the beta file.</p> <ol> <li>Pheno file:</li> <ul> <li>This file includes information about individuals, such as 'ID', 'Tissue', 'Disease', 'Condition', 'Age', 'Age_unit', 'Gender', 'Race', 'Platform'.</li> <li>The file name should end with "_pheno", for example, "GSE90060_pheno.csv".</li> <li>Note: The names of the pheno file and beta file should be the same before the "_" symbol, such as "GSE38873_beta.csv" and "GSE38873_pheno.csv". The two files should include the same individuals.</li> </ul> <li>Beta file:</li> <ul> <li>This file contains the degree of expression of the CPG locus of each individual.</li> <li>Each column represents the information of one individual, and each row represents the degree of expression of one CPG locus.</li> <li>The file name should end with "_beta", for example, "GSE20242_beta.csv". Please ensure that the two files have the same numbering and include the same individuals.</li> </ul> </ol> <p>After preparing the two files, our website will perform the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Checking the uploaded data.</li> <li>Creating tasks and allocating resources.</li> <li>Processing the data to predict age.</li> </ol> <p>Once the first two steps are completed, you have the option to either leave the website and wait for us to notify you via email when the data processing is finished, or you can stay on the wait page and monitor the progress through the displayed progress bar. Once the data processing is complete, you can click the "Result" button on the wait page toview the predicted result scatter plot.</p> <h4>Evaluation Module</h4>

    <p>This module displays our evaluation results of the 15 prediction methods. You can make a selection based on the desired model and dataset for visual comparison.</p>

    <p><strong>Steps to Follow</strong>:</p>

    <ol><li><p><strong>Select Dataset and Model</strong>: </p><ul><li>Log in to the platform and navigate to the &quot;View Evaluation Report&quot; module.</li><li><strong>Dataset Selection</strong>:<ul><li>You can select data samples based on dataset ID, tissue, disease, or race. </li><li>If selecting by <strong>Dataset ID</strong>: </li><li>You can choose one or more datasets from the table displayed on the page.</li><li>The table provides details such as dataset ID, age range, age unit, and the number of samples. Sorting by dataset ID and sample count in ascending or descending order is supported.</li><li>Pagination through the table is available, and the number of datasets displayed per page can be modified.</li><li>If selecting by <strong>tissue, disease, or race</strong>:</li><li>The page displays 24 tissue categories, 54 disease categories, and 8 race categories for users to choose from.</li><li>These categories are defined based on a mapping file.</li><li>Based on the above selection, you can further narrow down the choice by gender.</li></ul></li><li>First, choose the dataset of interest from the page table.</li><li><p><strong>Model Selection</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>After applying the desired filters and making selections, select the model(s) you wish to compare. Similar to the Online Prediction module, multiple models can be chosen for comparison.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>View Evaluation Results</strong>:</p><ul><li>After selecting the dataset and model(s), click the &quot;Result&quot; button in the upper right.</li><li><p>You&#39;ll be presented with several visual comparison charts showcasing the performance of each model on the selected dataset. </p><ul><li><strong>Viewing via Tables</strong>:</li><li>Sample Information Table: Provides a comprehensive view of each sample&#39;s details.</li><li>Predicted Age Table: Shows the predicted age for each sample based on the chosen model.</li><li><strong>Viewing via Graphs</strong>:</li><li>Multiple types of visual representations are available for better data interpretation:</li><li>Bar Chart: Assists in comparing age distributions across diverse datasets and categories.</li><li>Pie Chart: Provides a percentage distribution of various tissue or disease categories.</li><li><p>Scatter Plot: Helps in identifying patterns or relationships between true age and predicted age.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong> Detailed Analysis</strong>: </p><ul><li>If you need more in-depth data or analysis, click on the &quot; Comprehensive Report&quot; link under this page to view the full assessment report and other related information.</li></ul></li></ol>
